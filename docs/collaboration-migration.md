# Collaboration System Migration

## Overview

The collaboration system has been migrated from Supabase Realtime channels to WebRTC peer-to-peer connections. This provides better performance and reliability for real-time collaborative editing.

## Why the Migration?

1. **Binary Data Issues**: Supabase Realtime channels had issues transmitting binary Yjs update data, causing "Invalid typed array length" errors
2. **Connection Reliability**: WebRTC provides more stable peer-to-peer connections
3. **Lower Latency**: Direct peer connections reduce latency compared to server-mediated broadcasts
4. **Offline Support**: IndexedDB persistence allows offline editing with automatic sync

## New Architecture

### Components

1. **WebRTC Provider**: Handles peer-to-peer connections between users
2. **IndexedDB Persistence**: Stores document state locally for offline support
3. **Signaling Servers**: Public servers handle initial peer discovery

### How It Works

1. Users connect to the same document via WebRTC using the note ID as the room identifier
2. Yjs automatically syncs document state between all connected peers
3. Changes are persisted locally in IndexedDB
4. When users reconnect, their local changes sync with other peers

### Benefits

- No more binary data transmission issues
- Works with public signaling servers (no Supabase Realtime needed)
- Automatic conflict resolution via Yjs CRDTs
- Offline editing support
- Lower infrastructure costs

## Usage

The collaboration system is now integrated into the `CollaborativeEditorFinal` component. When sharing is enabled on a note, users automatically connect via WebRTC.

## Fallback

If WebRTC connections fail (e.g., due to firewalls), the system falls back to database-based syncing with periodic saves.
