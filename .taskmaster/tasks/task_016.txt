# Details:
Create landing page at app root (/) with sections: Hero (tagline + demo video/gif), Problem (cluttered tools, disconnected time management), Solution (unified workspace with 3 key features), Testimonials (placeholder for now), and Pricing.

Design with extreme minimalism: mostly white, one accent color, plenty of breathing room. Add sticky header with sign-in CTA. Implement smooth scroll to pricing section.

Add email capture for updates (store in Supabase). Create 404 page with clever message.

# Test Strategy:
Test on multiple devices and browsers. Verify all CTAs work correctly. Test page load speed (<2s). Validate SEO meta tags. Test social sharing previews. Ensure video plays on mobile. Test email capture works. Verify smooth scrolling. Check accessibility with screen reader.
