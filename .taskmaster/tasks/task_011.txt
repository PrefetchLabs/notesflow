# Task ID: 11
# Title: Add AI Writing Assistant with OpenAI Integration
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the AI writing assistant using BlockNote's built-in AI features via @blocknote/xl-ai package for context-aware AI assistance
# Details:
Install @blocknote/xl-ai package and leverage BlockNote's built-in AI capabilities including AIMenuController, custom AI commands, and streaming responses. Configure OpenAI integration using BlockNote's LLM interface. Implement custom AI commands for Continue Writing, Improve Clarity, Summarize, and Extract Tasks. Integrate AI menu with slash commands and keyboard shortcuts. Add usage tracking for free tier limits (10 AI calls per day). Create custom AI commands that work with BlockNote's existing AI infrastructure for better integration.

# Test Strategy:
Test BlockNote AI integration with various content types. Verify custom AI commands work properly. Test streaming responses through BlockNote's AI system. Ensure usage limits are enforced correctly. Test AI menu integration with slash commands. Verify keyboard shortcuts work across different systems.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Install BlockNote AI package and configure OpenAI [done]

### Details:
Import and configure AIMenuController from @blocknote/xl-ai, integrate with existing BlockNote editor setup, configure AI menu positioning and triggers, set up keyboard shortcuts for AI menu activation, ensure proper TypeScript integration

## 3. Create custom Continue Writing AI command [done]
### Dependencies: 11.1, 11.2
### Description: Implement Continue Writing feature using BlockNote's custom AI command system
### Details:
Create custom AI command using BlockNote's AI command interface, implement context-aware content continuation, integrate with AIMenuController, handle text insertion at cursor position using BlockNote's editor API

## 4. Create custom Improve Clarity AI command [done]
### Dependencies: 11.1, 11.2
### Description: Build Improve Clarity feature using BlockNote's AI command system
### Details:
Create custom AI command for text improvement, leverage BlockNote's text selection handling, implement diff view using BlockNote's built-in comparison features, integrate with AI menu for easy access

## 5. Create custom Summarize AI command [done]
### Dependencies: 11.1, 11.2
### Description: Implement summarization feature using BlockNote's AI infrastructure
### Details:
Create custom AI command for summarization, support both selected text and full note summarization using BlockNote's content extraction, add configurable summary length options, integrate with AI menu system

## 6. Create custom Extract Tasks AI command with time block integration [done]
### Dependencies: 11.1, 11.2
### Description: Extract actionable tasks using BlockNote AI and create corresponding time blocks
### Details:
Create custom AI command for task extraction using BlockNote's AI system, parse time estimates and priorities from AI response, integrate with existing time block system from Task 10, automatically create time blocks with extracted tasks, add preview functionality before creation
<info added on 2025-07-09T20:36:03.609Z>
Note: This subtask depends on Task 10 (Time-Blocking Calendar) being completed first, since it requires the ability to create time blocks in the calendar system. The time block creation functionality from Task 10 must be fully implemented before this feature can integrate with the existing time blocking system.

<info added on 2025-07-09T21:16:44.989Z>
Error handling implementation completed successfully. Fixed all TypeScript errors that were blocking AI functionality. Added comprehensive authentication error handling to gracefully manage API key issues and unauthorized requests. Resolved React console warnings related to prop passing in AI components. Temporarily switched to default AI menu implementation to bypass dictionary-related errors in custom menu integration - this provides stable AI functionality while custom menu issues are investigated and resolved. All core error handling features are now functional and user-tested.
