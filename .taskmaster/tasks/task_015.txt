# Task ID: 15
# Title: Create Minimal Onboarding Flow
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 14
# Priority: medium
# Description: Build a simple 3-screen onboarding for new users
# Details:
Create onboarding flow at /onboarding with 3 screens max. Screen 1: Welcome message with value prop 'Your thoughts and time, beautifully unified' and continue button. Screen 2: Show drag-to-calendar animation (using Framer Motion) with 'Try it yourself' prompt. Screen 3: Choose plan with free vs pro comparison, emphasizing 7-day trial. Use @radix-ui/react-navigation-menu@1.1.4 for step indicators. Add skip button for impatient users. Store onboarding completion in user preferences. Create smooth transitions between screens (300ms slide). Add keyboard navigation (Enter to continue, Escape to skip). Pre-create sample note 'Welcome to NotesFlow' with tutorial content. Auto-focus on first interactive element. Track onboarding completion rate. Design with maximum whitespace and minimal text.

# Test Strategy:
Test onboarding flow from start to finish. Verify skip functionality works. Test keyboard navigation. Ensure onboarding only shows once per user. Test plan selection leads to correct flow. Verify sample note is created. Test on mobile viewport. Measure completion rate.
