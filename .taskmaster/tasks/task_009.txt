# Task ID: 9
# Title: Create Time-Blocking Calendar Component
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: high
# Description: Build the unique time-blocking calendar with 15-minute grid on the right side
# Details:
Create calendar component with 15-minute time slots from 6 AM to 10 PM. Design as fixed-width (300px) right sidebar that can be toggled. Use CSS Grid for time slot layout with each slot being 20px height. Implement current time indicator as a subtle red line that updates every minute. Add week view with 7 columns for days, current day highlighted. Create TimeBlock component with title, duration visualization, and completion checkbox. Add smooth drag-to-resize for adjusting block duration. Implement visual feedback during drag: ghost element, valid drop zones highlighted. Store time blocks in database linked to notes and user. Add quick actions: click empty slot to create 30-min block, double-click to create 1-hour block. Show total focused time at top of calendar. Use subtle colors: completed blocks in light green, upcoming in light blue. Most core functionality now complete - focus on remaining polish items and testing.

# Test Strategy:
Test time block creation via clicking and dragging. Verify blocks save correctly to database. Test drag-to-resize functionality. Ensure current time indicator updates properly. Test week navigation. Verify time calculations are accurate. Test visual feedback during interactions. Validate performance with 50+ blocks per week. Write comprehensive test suite for all implemented functionality.

### Details:
Design styles for default, hover, active, and dragging states. Implement color theming system for different block categories. Add visual indicators for conflicts or overlaps. Create focus styles for keyboard navigation.

## 12. Add Performance Optimization [done]
### Dependencies: 9.5, 9.8
### Description: Optimize calendar rendering performance for handling many time blocks
### Details:
Implement React.memo for TimeBlock components. Use virtualization for blocks outside viewport. Batch database updates during drag operations. Optimize re-renders with proper key strategies. Add debouncing for resize updates.

React.memo has been successfully implemented for TimeBlock components along with efficient re-rendering strategies that prevent unnecessary updates. The component now properly memoizes based on block properties and only re-renders when relevant data changes. Next priorities are implementing virtualization for blocks outside the viewport to handle large datasets and optimizing batch database updates during drag operations to reduce API calls and improve performance during intensive interactions.
