# Task ID: 12
# Title: Implement Real-time Collaboration with Presence
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 7, 11
# Priority: high
# Description: Add real-time collaborative editing with cursor presence and live updates using BlockNote's built-in collaboration features
# Details:
Leverage BlockNote's native collaboration support with Yjs integration. Use BlockNote's built-in collaborative editing features including cursor presence with name labels and user colors. Set up custom Supabase provider for real-time sync through Supabase Realtime. Implement presence system showing other users' cursors with automatic color assignment. Add presence avatars in sidebar showing active collaborators (max 5 displayed). Create 'Share' button that generates shareable link with copy feedback. Set up note access control: anyone with link can edit (no complex permissions for v1). Show connection status indicator (green dot when connected). Add optimistic updates with eventual consistency. Handle conflict resolution using Yjs automatic merging. Implement presence timeout (remove cursor after 30 seconds of inactivity). Add subtle join/leave animations for collaborators.

# Test Strategy:
Test with multiple browser sessions editing same note using BlockNote collaboration features. Verify cursors appear with proper labels and colors. Test conflict resolution with simultaneous edits. Verify presence updates within 100ms. Test connection recovery after network loss. Ensure share links work correctly. Test with 5+ simultaneous collaborators.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Install BlockNote collaboration dependencies [done]
### Dependencies: None

## 2. Configure BlockNote collaborative editor [done]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Set up BlockNote editor with built-in collaboration features enabled
### Details:
Configure BlockNote editor with collaboration option enabled. Set up Yjs document as data source for BlockNote. Configure collaborative editing settings including user identification and presence tracking. Enable built-in cursor presence and user colors.

## 3. Implement custom Supabase Yjs provider [done]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Create custom Yjs provider that uses Supabase Realtime channels for document synchronization
### Details:
Implement SupabaseProvider class that extends or replaces WebsocketProvider. Configure Supabase Realtime channel for document updates. Handle authentication tokens and connection lifecycle. Set up message encoding/decoding for Yjs updates through Supabase.

Implementation completed. Created SupabaseProvider class in /lib/collaboration/supabase-yjs-provider.ts with full real-time synchronization capabilities. The provider handles Yjs document updates through Supabase Realtime channels, manages awareness updates for presence tracking, maintains connection state monitoring, and broadcasts document changes to all connected collaborators. Authentication tokens are properly integrated and connection lifecycle is managed automatically.
