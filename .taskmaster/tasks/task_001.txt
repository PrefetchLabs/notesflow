# Task ID: 1
# Title: Initialize Next.js 15 Project with Core Dependencies
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up the foundational Next.js 15 project with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and essential dependencies for the NotesFlow MLP
# Details:
Create a new Next.js 15 project using the latest app router. Install and configure: next@15.0.3, react@19.0.0, react-dom@19.0.0, typescript@5.3.3, tailwindcss@3.4.1, @tailwindcss/typography@0.5.10, framer-motion@11.0.3, and postcss@8.4.33. Set up TypeScript with strict mode enabled. Configure Tailwind with a minimalist theme using system font stack and limited color palette (black, white, single accent color). Set up project structure with /app directory for Next.js 15 app router, /components for reusable UI components, /lib for utilities, and /types for TypeScript interfaces. Ensure the development server runs with sub-50ms response times.

# Test Strategy:
Verify project initialization by running 'npm run dev' and checking that the development server starts successfully. Confirm TypeScript compilation works without errors. Test that Tailwind CSS is properly configured by creating a test component with utility classes. Measure initial page load performance to ensure it meets <1s first paint target.
