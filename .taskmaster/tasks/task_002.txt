# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Google OAuth with Better-Auth
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up Google OAuth authentication using better-auth library for secure user sign-in
# Details:
Install better-auth@0.3.0 and configure Google OAuth provider. Set up OAuth credentials in Google Cloud Console with proper redirect URIs for development and production. Create auth configuration in /lib/auth.ts with Better-Auth setup. Implement auth API routes in /app/api/auth/[...all]/route.ts. Create a simple sign-in page at /app/auth/signin/page.tsx with Google sign-in button. Set up middleware.ts to protect routes and redirect unauthenticated users. Create auth context provider for client-side auth state management. Implement user session management with proper token handling and refresh logic. Store minimal user data (id, email, name, avatar) in session.

# Test Strategy:
Test complete OAuth flow from sign-in to sign-out. Verify redirect behavior for protected routes. Confirm session persistence across page refreshes. Test token refresh mechanism. Validate that user data is properly stored and accessible throughout the app. Test error handling for failed authentication attempts.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up Google Cloud Console OAuth 2.0 credentials [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create and configure OAuth 2.0 credentials in Google Cloud Console for the application
### Details:
Navigate to Google Cloud Console, create a new project or select existing one, enable Google+ API, create OAuth 2.0 credentials with proper redirect URIs (http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google for development and production URL), download credentials JSON, and store client ID and secret securely in environment variables
<info added on 2025-07-09T05:35:45.081Z>
Created comprehensive Google OAuth setup documentation at docs/google-oauth-setup.md with step-by-step instructions for Google Cloud Console configuration. Documentation includes creating/selecting a project, enabling Google+ API, creating OAuth 2.0 credentials, configuring redirect URIs for both development (http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google) and production environments, and securely storing Client ID and Client Secret in .env.local file. Currently waiting for user to complete the Google Cloud Console setup process before proceeding with better-auth package installation and configuration.
